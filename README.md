# Plotting polynomial function in Python

## What is polynomial functions ?

Polynomial functions are among the simplest, most important, and most commonly used mathematical functions. These functions consist of one or more terms of variables with whole number exponents

A polynomial function is a function such as a quadratic, a cubic, a quartic, and so on, involving only non-negative integer powers of x. We can give a general definition of a polynomial, and deﬁne its degree
for an example

```bash
f(x) = 4x³ — 3x² + 2
```

this function called as cubic polynomial because polynomial of degree 3,as 3 is the highest power of x formula

```bash
f(x) = 4x²− 2x− 4
```

This is called as a quadratic.which is a polynomial of degree 2, as 2 is the highest power of x.
lets plot simple function using python

ex :

```bash
 f(x) = x ² — 2x + 5
```

### Prerequisites

● numy

● matplotlib

Lets see another complex polynomial function

ex :

```bash
 f(x) = x ³— 3x³ — 35x²+39x + 70
```

this how the graph shows for this function

This is how basic plotting polynomial using python lets see another artical for advance polynomial functions

## What is this Graph Plotting ?

This graph depicts the density of state with varying value of "a" from the Subject of Electronic Properties of Materials , of Mettullargy and Materials Engineering (MT303 - 26427)

Here we are plotting the density of state graph with varying value of "a" such as 2 A , 5 A , 10 A all in one Graph.

Here we plot the graph in Python with help of

● numy

● matplotlib
